## Sales Insights and Performance Dashboard for NVIDIA

Analysed over 150,000 sales transactions for NVIDIA, which is facing issues in terms of its sales. My work as a Data Analyst is to unlock insights that are not visible before the sales team for decision support & automate them to reduce the manual time spent in data gathering. This is done by creating an automated SQL and Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vaibhav.ramakrishnan/viz/SalesAnalysis-IndianMarketsCustomers/Dashboard1) that optimizes revenue tracking, product mix strategies, and regional performance insights helping in data-driven decision making.

### Recommendations & Insights
-A few products like Product065 and customers like Excel stores had high Revenue by year during early COVID stages in 2020,  so I would have recommended considering reallocating the budget to the higher performing category of Product065 contributing to an expected 8.5% boost in quarterly revenue. 

1. The overall sales are declining - $42 Million in January 2018 to close to $26 Million in January 2020
2. Prod040 had the highest revenue close to $24 Million
3. Electricalsara Stores is the biggest customer for NVIDIA
4. Delhi NCR is the biggest city contributing to the business
5. Projected to boost quarterly revenue by 8.5% - through enhanced market penetration, and streamlining decision-making for 38 key customers
